# BALBOT
BALBOT is a Raspberry Pi 5â€“powered robotic system that uses real-time computer vision and closed-loop servo control to keep a ball balanced at the center of an acrylic plate. A wide-angle camera tracks the ball's position while three precision servos dynamically tilt the plate to maintain equilibrium.
